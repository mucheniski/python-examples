# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
# a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
# Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has
# only the even elements of this list in it.


randomList = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
evenList = [number for number in randomList if number % 2 == 0]
print(evenList)
